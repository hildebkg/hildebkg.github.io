							<h1>MakeUC Director</h1>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>When I started my college career at UC in fall 2020, one of the first things I did was 
								join its chapter of IEEE, or the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
								I knew of its existence from a young age thanks to my dad, who has been a professional 
								member of the organization for as long as I can remember. Since I was accepted into the 
								electrical engineering program, joining IEEE felt like the natural thing to do. At the 
								end of my freshman year, I received an email asking for people to volunteer to organize 
								MakeUC, which is the hackathon hosted by IEEE every fall. It had been held completely 
								online the previous semester, and I had briefly attended bits and pieces of the event. It 
								sounded like a great way to finally get more involved with the club, so I jumped at the 
								opportunity. I was placed on the Marketing Team and spent the next several months working 
								alongside the other organizers to plan the event. Although I did not have a leadership 
								role, I felt like I was able to meaningfully contribute to the planning. When the 
								opportunity came along later to be president of the club, and consequently the director 
								of MakeUC as well, I was nervous but excited to see what I could accomplish. </p>
							<h2>The Experience</h2>
							<p>Organizing a hackathon requires more time, money, and planning than one may think. While 
								MakeUC occurs in October every year, the organization of the event begins as early as 
								late April or early May. Everyone who volunteers to be an organizer is assigned to one of 
								four teams: marketing, logistics, sponsorship, or technology. Each team has its own team 
								leader, and all of the teams are overseen by the director. My main job as director was to 
								coordinate all of the necessary activities by organizing them into categories and 
								disseminating them to the appropriate team(s). I was then responsible for making sure each 
								task was assigned to team members and completed successfully. In order to fully understand 
								everything that was going on, I opted for a hands-on approach, attending each team's meetings 
								and doing tasks assigned to me by team leaders. Each team met every other week, and I met 
								with the team leaders once a week.</p>
							<p>MakeUC was also one of the most rewarding things I have ever done. One of my main goals was to make 
								it much easier for organizers who came after us to start organizing the event each year, which I 
								believe we accomplished by maintaining detailed meeting notes and calendars throughout the 
								organizing process. Another thing I was happy about was the fact that I got to befriend so 
								many of the organizers. Although we had to do a lot of the organization virtually due to people 
								being on co-op or off-campus, I still got to know a lot of the organizers well, and I sincerely 
								hope that they enjoyed their experience enough to consider doing it again this year. Finally, I 
								was happy with the overall success of the event, and I am extremely excited to do it again this 
								year (2023!). As a team, we have compiled the things that we thought went well and the things that we 
								want to improve, and I am confident that this year's event will be even better than last year's. </p>
							<p>As part of my experience, I wrote a short article about MakeUC for the IEEE Student Magazine, which is 
								the student magazine published annually by IEEE at UC. Please feel free to take a look at it below to 
								learn more about what actually happened at the event! You can also learn more about MakeUC by visiting
