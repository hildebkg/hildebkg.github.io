							<h2>Prompt: What specific experiences (honors or otherwise) in the past year have had the most impact on your personal, 
								academic, or professional goals and life trajectory? Which future experiences will further encourage this growth? 
								Please articulate specific academic and/or professional goals for the next year.</h2>
							<p>One of the most important experiences I had this past year was directing MakeUC. MakeUC is an annual 24-hour hackathon 
								hosted by IEEE at UC in which students from all over the world can participate on campus or online. They attend workshops, 
								network with sponsors and other students, and create hardware and/or software projects to compete for tens of thousands of 
								dollars in prizes. This experience was so important to me because it was a huge challenge. I had never done something like 
								this before, so there was a large learning curve, and it required a lot of leadership, responsibility, time management, 
								and planning. I had to make sure I was improving all these skills throughout the process, which lasted about five months. 
								I came out of it feeling more confident about myself and my abilities. I also strengthened existing friendships and made a 
								ot of new ones, which was probably my favorite part of the whole endeavor. In order to continue this growth, I will be 
								directing MakeUC again this year, along with many of the same people! I am very confident that we will be able to effectively 
								take everything we learned last year and make this year's event even better. I am also confident that it will be much less 
								of a learning curve for me (and others who are doing it again) and will instead be a great way to make a lasting impact on 
								the organization by setting it up for success for future years.</p>
							<p>Another extremely important experience I had was my second co-op semester this past fall. This experience was so 
								important for me because it opened my eyes to a lot of concepts, technologies, and skills that I otherwise would not have 
								been exposed to (or that I would have been exposed to much later on). Because so many of the things I was working with were 
								new to me, it was a significant challenge. This also meant, however, that I was learning new things every single day. I am 
								very grateful for this co-op experience because it motivated me to put more effort into learning on my own time and 
								xploring concepts that we had not covered in school semesters. It also helped me to get used to being outside of my comfort 
								zone and asking others for assistance. In the past, I have been hesitant to ask others for help because I am afraid of them 
								thinking I am not smart or experienced enough. However, through practice, I am slowly becoming better at reminding myself 
								that everyone has to start somewhere, and that most people are willing to help you as long as you try! I am currently on 
								co-op with the same company this semester, and I am sure that I will continue to grow in the same ways.</p>
							<p>Thanks to these experiences (and others), there are a few goals that I hope to achieve in the coming year. The first is that 
								I would like to direct MakeUC this year in a more efficient, creative, and confident way by using what I learned from last 
								year's experience. Another goal of mine is to continue taking my co-op experiences in stride and learning as much as I can 
								from them. Self-confidence has been a common theme in a lot of my experiences, and I think it is very good that I have been 
								challenged both in terms of academic skills and interpersonal skills. In order to continue my improvement in these areas, I 
								will continue to work hard in and out of work to increase my technical skillset and my belief in my abilities. Finally, my 
								third goal is to try at least two new things in the new year. MakeUC and academic responsibilities took up the vast majority 
								of my time last year, and although I don't regret anything, I am disappointed that I was not able to make more time to try 
								ther things that I was interested in. Therefore, I will do my best in the future to get more involved in new organizations, 
								hobbies, or other areas that catch my eye while maintaining my current responsibilities.</p>
