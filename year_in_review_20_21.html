							<h2>Prompt: In what way(s) did you personally grow this year? How did you 
								demonstrate or rebuild the resilience needed to move forward during 
								this time? How will you utilize resources and your support network to 
								hold yourself accountable in continuing this growth?</h2>
							<p>Unsurprisingly, my first year of college turned out to be a lot different 
								than I imagined when I first decided I wanted to go to UC. When I realized 
								that almost every aspect of school was going to change, I was disappointed 
								at first, but I soon decided that I needed to make the most of it. There 
								were a lot of new challenges, but I think that they provided me with many 
								ways to grow as a person and as a student. Since most of my classes were 
								online and at times asynchronous, I had to take responsibility for my 
								learning in a new way. I had to keep track of everything I had to do and 
								make sure I was putting in the effort to learn the material, especially for 
								my asynchronous classes. That experience taught me that I cannot rely on others to 
								teach me what I need to know- I need to be able to take initiative and make sure 
								that I am understanding the content, studying, and completing any necessary work. 
								In addition to growing as a student, I think I personally grew a lot this year. 
								Because of the pandemic, I did not spend a lot of time with friends and family 
								like I normally would, which taught me that I need to value the time spent with 
								these people even more than I already do. I also found myself changing a lot 
								socially- in past years, I was always very outgoing and wanted to talk to people 
								whenever I could. Now, however, I find myself spending less time with fewer people 
								and valuing my alone time more. I think that I realized the importance of maintaining 
								the most important bonds in my life, such as with family and close friends, and not 
								feeling the need to make as many friends or spend as much time with other people as 
								possible. In addition to this, in past years, I found it easy to feel lonely or sad 
								when I wasn't constantly in contact with people. Now, on the other hand, I think I have 
								realized that even if I haven't talked to someone in a while or have been spending a lot 
								of time by myself, the people who care about me haven't gone anywhere. Even if it does 
								not feel like it, I'll always have people who I can talk to and who support me.</p>
							<p>There was a lot of resilience needed to move forward throughout this year. There 
								were periods of time in which I felt that I had no motivation to stay on top of things. 
								There were even moments in which I felt that I was not smart enough to complete my 
								degree. I was able to demonstrate the necessary resilience by reminding myself how 
								lucky I am to be able to pursue a degree and receive a great education. I also 
								reminded myself how much I desire to be an electrical engineer in the future. By keeping 
								these sentiments in mind, I was able to keep myself motivated and consistently work hard.</p>
							<p>In order to hold myself accountable for the continuation of the growth I experienced 
								this year, I will utilize various resources and members of my support network. I think one 
								of the most obvious resources is a planner- I always had my planner with me whenever I was 
								doing work this year, and keeping track of everything in it will be something I continue to 
								do for the foreseeable future. Another resource that I valued a lot this year was my 
								academic advisor- she was always extremely friendly and helpful, and I know I can go to her 
								ith any questions or concerns I may have in the future. In terms of my support network, I 
								will be sure to continue staying in touch with my parents and my older sister while I am at 
								school. I will also spend more time with my roommate (who also happens to be my twin sister). 
								These things will ensure that I continue growing as a student and as a person next year and beyond.</p>
