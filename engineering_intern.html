							<h1>Mechanical Engineering Intern</h1>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>This experience came as a surprise to me- I didn't plan on working over the summer, but 
								when I received the offer to work as an intern for Rieck Services, I decided to seize 
								the opportunity. Rieck Services is one of the largest and most successful mechanical 
								contractors in the Dayton, Ohio area, providing services that range from HVAC repairs 
								to designing and building new structures. When I applied to attend the University of 
								Cincinnati, I was originally trying to decide whether I wanted to go into mechanical 
								or electrical engineering.  Although I am now completely confident in my choice of 
								major, I was still excited to experience a totally different field of engineering, 
								especially one I've always been interested in!</p>
							<h2>The Experience</h2>
							<p>My main responsibilities were drafting proposals and price estimates for various jobs, 
								performing HVAC-related calculations such as heating and cooling loads, and creating 
								and/or modifying schematics and drawings in AutoCAD MEP 2021. I also attended numerous 
								job sites and assisted with surveying and assessing them. I had zero experience with 
								AutoCAD before working for Rieck, so I decided to compile some of the schematics and 
								drawings that I worked on to show some of my progress. You can see them below! They 
								are in order of when I made them (the oldest ones appear first) to better show any 
								improvements.</p>
