							<h1>Bearcats Academy Mentor</h1>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>When I was accepted into the honors program, I knew I wanted to do a self-designed 
								experience as soon as possible. The opportunity to do so came very quickly- I 
								heard about Bearcats Academy early on in my first semester and immediately joined. 
								Bearcats Academy is a program that is partnered with three public high schools in 
								Cincinnati, Ohio. The goal of the program is to pair high school students with 
								students at the University of Cincinnati in order to form "mentor-mentee" 
								relationships that foster learning, personal growth, and success. I am really 
								grateful I had the opportunity to participate in the program. I learned how to be 
								a more confident mentor and leader and how to form better relationships with others. 
								My mentee did a fantastic job completing all of the curriculum for this year and I 
								loved seeing her improve academically and decide to get more involved in 
								extracurriculars. She inspired me to do the same!</p>
							<h2>The Experience</h2>
							<p>The main thing that I do as a mentor for Bearcats Academy is meet with my mentee, 
								on average, once a week. Each session lasts an hour and covers a different topic. 
								Each grade has a certain goal or theme to focus on for the year. Since my mentee 
								was a freshman during the 2020-2021 school year, our focus was research. I am 
								responsible for preparing every week by looking over the curriculums given for each 
								session and devising a plan which goes in my mentor session log. The most recent 
								version of that document can be found below. I chose to highlight this document 
								because it includes all of the activities we completed and commentary on how some of 
								the sessions went. It gives a great overview of the things we learned and accomplished 
								this year!</p>
