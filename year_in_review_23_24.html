							<h2>Prompt: In what way(s) did you personally grow this year? How did you demonstrate or rebuild the 
								resilience needed to move forward? How will you utilize resources and your support network to hold 
								yourself accountable in continuing this growth?‚Äù</h2>
							<p>One of the most important experiences from this year was, of course, MakeUC 2023! This was my second year 
								as director of the event, which is an annual hackathon hosted by IEEE at UC. The competition took place on 
								November 4th and 5th, but the preparation first started in April of that same year. I was particularly 
								excited to direct the event this year because many of the people who had participated in the previous year 
								were returning to volunteer again. These people also happened to be my good friends, which always makes things 
								more fun! My experience directing MakeUC 2022 was very different from my experience in 2023, particularly 
								because it was my first time undertaking a project of that magnitude. In 2023, I had much more experience and 
								confidence in my abilities. However, the main challenge for this year was the fact that we were trying out a 
								new venue - the 1819 Innovation Hub. This meant that a lot of our planning from the previous year was no longer 
								applicable, and that we had to navigate working with a completely new group of people. All in all, I think the 
								event went smoothly, and I felt like we did a great job of adapting to the new aspects of the event while also 
								re-using and/or maintaining what we had used in previous years. However, it took a lot of discipline, teamwork, 
								and very long nights. I would not have been able to move forward with everything had it not been for all the 
								amazing people on our team. </p>
							<p>	I think that another important growing experience I had this year was my decision not to run for the executive 
								board for IEEE again for the upcoming 2024-2025 academic year. I have spent quite a bit of time writing about my 
								experiences in IEEE in my year-in-reviews, but I don't think I have ever fully expressed just how important the 
								club has been to me over the last several years. As I've mentioned before, I have been a member of IEEE since my 
								freshman year, and my college experience would have been drastically different without it. I made many new friends 
								and learned a lot as a member in my first few years, but becoming president of the club is what had the biggest 
								impact on me. It truly taught me so much about leadership; made me a more outgoing, assertive, and confident 
								person; and exposed me to so many different people and opportunities. This year, I struggled immensely with the 
								decision to run or not run for another position in the club, and I ultimately decided to bow out altogether. 
								Although I think of IEEE in nothing but a positive light, it is true that it has been an immense responsibility 
								over the last two years, and I felt as if it was time to devote some of that time to other endeavors. After all, 
								the most important part of my time with IEEE has always been the people, and they aren't going anywhere! I plan to 
								remain involved with as many events as possible and help wherever I can, but not being directly responsible for 
								anything is a huge weight off my shoulders. I am excited to have more flexibility for my senior year, and I plan to 
								follow through with my goal from last year to get involved with new organizations and hobbies. </p>
							<p>	Finally, I have continued to grow professionally this year through my co-op experiences. I completed my fourth semester 
								with HII in the spring of this year and have continued straight into my fifth and final semester this summer. This job 
								has been a non-stop learning experience, and I am very grateful for the challenges and the mentorship. However, I have 
								struggled somewhat with trying to maintain a good work-life balance and trying to decide what I want to commit to when 
								I return to the company full-time after graduation. Many of my coworkers have provided valuable advice and support when 
								it comes to getting me involved in new projects and/or new teams, and I will continue to work with them to figure out 
								how I can best contribute to the organization.</p>
