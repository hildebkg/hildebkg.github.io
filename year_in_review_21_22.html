							<h2>Prompt: What specific experiences (honors or otherwise) in the past year 
								have had the most impact on your personal, academic, or professional goals 
								and life trajectory? Which future experiences will further encourage this 
								growth? Please articulate specific academic and/or professional goals for 
								the next year.</h2>
							<p>This past year, I was able to form much more concrete professional goals thanks 
								to my first co-op experience. I was very lucky to work for Huntington Ingalls 
								Industries at Wright Patterson Air Force Base for the spring semester and will 
								be returning there for my next co-op in the fall. One of the reasons this 
								experience was so impactful to my professional goals was because it exposed me 
								to many different projects. Before this experience, I was confident in my major 
								and my interests, but I was not sure how to pinpoint which interests and specific 
								areas of study were best suited to me. While I worked on several projects 
								throughout my co-op, I had two larger, long-term projects that were quite 
								different from one another and that helped me discover what I enjoyed most. One 
								project was a desktop application that I developed; another was a circuit board 
								that I helped design. Both projects were very different in the sense that they 
								required completely different knowledge and skills. I was grateful to work on both 
								because they provided me with the time and practice necessary to better determine 
								what I enjoyed doing most. The entire experience on co-op increased my confidence 
								in my field and introduced me to several new skills, some of which I had never even 
								heard of! Many skills, like soldering, were so enjoyable that I invested time 
								outside of work to continue improving them. This experience as a whole has helped me 
								form one specific professional goal in particular: I want to stay with the company 
								for future co-ops and then work there full-time after graduation! Future experiences 
								that will encourage this growth include, of course, my upcoming fall co-op as well as 
								any other co-op positions I may have with the company. The facility in which I work 
								has two main divisions: testing and systems development. I was heavily involved in 
								systems development this past semester, so I plan to be more involved in testing in 
								the fall. This change will expose me to even more situations and skills and will help 
								me decide what exactly I want to do as a life-long career.</p>
							<p>While I was able to set some important goals this year, I have a few more that I would 
								like to work towards next year. One academic goal I have is to take my first honors 
								seminar! There is a seminar called Pinball Design and Programming that I have been 
								trying to take since I was a freshman, and my goal is to make room in my schedule to 
								take it in 2023. I am extremely excited, both for the class content and for the 
								professor! Another academic goal that I have for next year is to get more directly 
								involved in one of my favorite classes by being a teaching assistant or a tutor. I have 
								really enjoyed a lot of my classes so far, and I would love to help other people be 
								successful with them. I would really like to tutor and/ or help teach because it helps 
								me keep the concepts fresh in my mind. I also find it really interesting and helpful 
								when people ask me questions about topics, because they often think of things in ways 
								that I don't. In summary, I learned and grew a lot this past year, and I will use this 
								progress to guide and inspire my growth for next year!</p>
