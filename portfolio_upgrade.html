							<h1>Portfolio Upgrade</h1>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>I have always been impressed by my friends with experience in web development. When 
								you are surfing the internet, you probably aren't stopping to think about the work that 
								went into creating each website you visit. Like many others, web development had been a 
								black box for me until I got involved with MakeUC this past year. Working closely with the 
								MakeUC Tech Team gave me a newfound sense of appreciation for web developers and the skills 
								that they must have. Through MakeUC, I actually made my first-ever contribution to an open-source 
								project (the MakeUC website) and obtained my first experience in web development. Although it 
								wasn't super in-depth, it was enough to make me feel interested and confident enough to make my 
								own website. It was at that point that I had the idea to re-do my UHP portfolio! I was confident 
								that the project would be reasonably beginner-friendly because my portfolio did not require 
								anything complicated, and because it would be easy to transfer the content from my previous 
								portfolio to the newly-designed portfolio.
							</p>
							<h2>The Experience</h2>
							<p>This experience was a lot of fun! I really enjoyed practicing the skills that I had to learn 
								for MakeUC and applying them to something that was my own. It was quite daunting at first 
								because I have never started anything like this from scratch. With MakeUC, I had simply been 
								contributing to something that was already set up. In that case, I didn't need to understand 
								how everything worked, because it was usually pretty intuitive to figure out what I needed to do 
								to the existing code to make certain changes. To get myself going, I took a  similar approach with this 
								project and came across HTML5UP, a website that compiles very nice templates for free under Creative 
								Commons. Once I found one that fit the vibe I was looking for, it became a lot easier to get everything 
								completed. The portfolio is hosted for free through GitHub pages. It is built with Responsive Tools 
								(a framework for responsive websites/web apps) and jQuery (a JavaScript library that makes many HTML 
								operations easier). I made my changes in HTML5 and CSS3. 
								As I continue to develop the portfolio in the future, I would like to get even deeper into the technology 
								behind it and look into creating some of my own custom elements for the website. To see what's going 
								on behind the scenes, feel free to check out the GitHub repository below!
