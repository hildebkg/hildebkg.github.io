							<h1>Innovation Challenge</h1>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>The Innovation Challenge (IC) is a program hosted every semester (fall, spring, and summer) by
							CEAS Tribunal and the Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Cincinnati. The main program, 
							or IC 1, consists mainly of coming up with an idea for a product, making a pitch deck for the idea, 
							creating a prototype, and presenting your pitch deck/prototype at the end of the semester to a panel of 
							judges. This semester (fall 2023), a follow-up program called IC 2 was created. This program was meant to 
							be a step forward for students who were already very experienced with Innovation Challenge 1 or who were 
							really passionate about taking an idea beyond what IC 1 mainly supports. I previously participated in IC 1 in 
							the spring with a team of fellow electrical engineering students and then did a solo project in the summer. 
							In the spring, my team and I came up with the idea to create new-and-improved electronics kits aimed at 
							students and hobbyists. This is the idea we carried into IC 2 this semester.
							</p>

							<h2>The Experience</h2>
							<p>As students and hobbyists ourselves, we had noticed that electronics kits available on 
							the market these days were too superficial to be of use to us. There are many great kits out there that teach 
							the basics of electronics, but because they are aimed at beginners, they do not really get into the weeds of the 
							topics. They give a good starting point, but do not give you practical tips, tricks, and general knowledge that can 
							be applied to a wider range of projects. When kits do cover more advanced topics, they usually assume you have 
							the necessary prerequisite knowledge, and only briefly cover the theory and/or design criteria (if at all). It is 
							very common to find a great kit out there, whether it be to build an AM/FM radio or build a robot car, 
							but the common factor is that they do not explain the underlying electronics and design theory well enough. 
							After noticing this over time, we decided we wanted to provide a solution to this problem - UpLabs! UpLabs 
							is the name we gave to our idea for a business that creates electronics kits focused on teaching the engineering 
							and design theory behind practical projects and that are aimed towards all audiences - complete beginners 
							will learn everything they need to know, and those with a more experience will still benefit from the formal 
							instruction and added theory.
							<br>
							IC 2 was a unique experience for which I am very grateful. The program was underway from late August until 
							late November with meetings every Wednesday. The meeting topics varied; we would have work sessions with our 
							teams, Q&A sessions with startup founders, team-building activities, etc. Throughout the program, we received 
							valuable guidance from Cadence Wade, the program leader, and Dr. Jason Heikenfeld. They each gave us great 
							advice on our idea and how to improve our understanding of the problem we were trying to solve, our business 
							model, and our goals. We hope to finish our prototype at some point next year while we work simultaneously on 
							more market research and general promotions. We canâ€™t wait to see what we accomplish!
							<br>
							As mentioned previously, one of the main aspects of IC 1 was creating a pitch deck for our idea, which is essentially a 
							presentation that you would use when speaking to potential investors or anyone else who may be interested in your 
							idea. It explains the problem, how your product solves it, your business model, and more. You can check out our 
							initial pitch deck from spring 2023 below! Please note that it has not yet been edited to reflect our progress from this 
							semester, and it does not include our new team member.
